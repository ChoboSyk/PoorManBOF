    "remarks": "This function creates a DirectWrite factory object that is used for subsequent creation of individual DirectWrite objects.  DirectWrite factory contains internal state data such as font loader registration and cached font data.  In most cases it is recommended you use the shared factory object, because it allows multiple components that use DirectWrite to share internal DirectWrite state data, and thereby reduce memory usage.  However, there are cases when it is desirable to reduce the impact of a component,  such as a plug-in from an untrusted source, on the rest of the process, by sandboxing and isolating it from the rest of the process components. In such cases, it is recommended you use an isolated factory for the sandboxed component. The following example shows how to create a shared DirectWrite factory. ",
