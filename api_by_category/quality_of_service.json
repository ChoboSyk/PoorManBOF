The  WSCInstallQOSTemplate function installs a QOS-named template containing the specified and subsequently associated  QOS structure, or replaces settings of an existing template. Values are stored in nonvolatile storage, so subsequent calls to  WSAGetQOSByName, passing the same lpQOSName, return the  QOS structure. If lpProviderId is set to NULL, the installed QOS-named template applies across all service providers; otherwise the QOS-named template applies only to the provider indicated by the lpProviderId parameter. Windows Sockets 2 includes a base set of QOS templates. You can override and replace any of these QOS templates or change an existing QOS template by simply installing a new template with the existing name. You do not need to delete an existing template before replacing or modifying it. You cannot delete the base set of QOS-named templates included in Windows Sockets 2. However, you can delete templates added subsequently, perhaps by other service providers. The lpQOS parameter, which points to a  QOS structure, can include a  ProviderSpecific buffer that will be stored with the basic  QOS structure and returned in subsequent  WSAGetQOSByName calls. You can provide the ProviderSpecific buffer\u00e2\u0080\u0094even if lpProviderId is set to NULL\u00e2\u0080\u0094to install global name templates that include provider-specific information. Note that this practice may lead the service provider to ignore the ProviderSpecific buffer if the service provider does not recognize its contents. The recommended use of  WSCInstallQOSTemplate is to include a ProviderSpecific buffer only if the named template is being installed on a particular service provider, as implemented when lpProviderId is not NULL.
