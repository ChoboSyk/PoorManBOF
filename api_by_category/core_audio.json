    "remarks": "This function enables Windows Store apps to  activate certain WASAPI COM interfaces after using Windows Runtime APIs in the Windows.Devices and Windows.Media.Devices namespaces to select an audio device. An application must call this function from the main UI thread to activate a COM interface in the WASAPI family. The application passes an IActivateAudioInterfaceCompletionHandler callback COM interface through completionHandler. Windows calls a method in the application's IActivateAudioInterfaceCompletionHandler interface from a worker thread in the COM Multi-threaded Apartment (MTA) when the activation results are available. The application can then call a method in the IActivateAudioInterfaceAsyncOperation interface  to retrieve the result code and the requested WASAPI interface. Windows holds a reference to the application's IActivateAudioInterfaceCompletionHandler interface until the operation is complete and the application releases the IActivateAudioInterfaceAsyncOperation interface. Depending on which WASAPI interface is activated, this function may display a consent prompt the first time it is called. For example, when the application calls this function to activate IAudioClient to access a microphone, the purpose of the consent prompt is to get the user's permission for the app to access the microphone. For more information about the consent prompt, see Guidelines for devices that access personal data. ActivateAudioInterfaceAsync must be called on the main UI thread so that the consent prompt can be shown. If the consent prompt can't be shown, the user can't grant device access to the app. ActivateAudioInterfaceAsync must be called on a thread in a COM Single-Threaded Apartment (STA). The completionHandler that is passed into ActivateAudioInterfaceAsync needs to implement IAgileObject to ensure that there is no deadlock when the completionHandler is called from the MTA. Otherwise, an E_ILLEGAL_METHOD_CALL will occur. ",
